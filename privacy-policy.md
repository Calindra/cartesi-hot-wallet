**Privacy Policy**  
*Effective Date: 2025-04-07*

**Cartesi Hot Wallet** ("we", "our", or "us") values your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our mobile application (“App”).

### 1. **Self-Custody and User Control**

Our App is built with **self-custody** as a core principle. This means that all sensitive data — such as private keys, wallets, or authentication credentials — is **generated and stored locally on your device**.  
We **do not collect, access, transmit, or store** any of this information on our servers or any third-party servers.

### 2. **No Data Collection**

We do not collect any personal data from you.  
Specifically:  
- We do not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or addresses  
- We do not track your usage behavior  
- We do not use analytics or advertising tools  
- We do not send or receive any personal or wallet information from your device

### 3. **Permissions and Local Processing**

Our App may request certain permissions (such as access to internet or local storage) to function correctly. These permissions are used **only for local processing** and to interact with decentralized networks like Cartesi. No data is transmitted or collected from these interactions.

### 4. **Third-Party Services**

We do not use third-party analytics, trackers, or advertising tools. Any communication with external networks (e.g., Cartesi, Ethereum) happens directly from your device and is under your control.

### 5. **Security**

We take security seriously and follow best practices to ensure that your private keys and other sensitive data remain secure and accessible only to you. We do not have access to or control over this data.

### 6. **Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be posted within the App and/or on our website. You will always have access to the latest version of the policy.

### 7. **No Password or Key Recovery**

As a self-custody application, you are solely responsible for managing and backing up your private keys, recovery phrases, or any credentials used to access your account or wallet.  
We **do not have access to your keys**, and we **cannot help you recover** your account if this information is lost.

Please make sure to **securely store any recovery phrases or backup files**.  
**Losing them means losing access to your assets permanently.**
